<h2>My top 3 favorite movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Valerian And the city of a Thousend Planets</h3>
<p>It was the first favorite movie I saw, I used to hate movies and going to the cinema because I didn't like it but when I saw this movie, the amount of colors, beautiful and radiant scenes made me love the movie and how it looked like</p>
<h3>Mario Bros</h3>
<p>It filled me with memories and nostalgia to see all the references and objects and movements that were in my nintendo 3ds, I always liked how it looked and see all that faithfully represented in the movie I loved it.</p>
<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>A movie that made me love music, cars and action, I wasn't a big fan of movies as I said but the perfect mix of these 3 things in the movie made me start obsessing about cars and music.</p>
